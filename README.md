## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Display weather.
- Display weather tomorrow.
- Display weather the next day after tomorrow.
- Search for city and display weather.
- Display 7 day forecast.


### Screenshot

![](<./public/localhost_3000_(iPhone%2012%20Pro).png>)

<!-- Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above. -->

<!-- **Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.** -->

## My process

Basic HTML, logic, styling.

### Built with

- Next.js
- Tailwind

### What I learned

I learned how to use React Hooks such as useState and useEffect (again).
How to intereact with the weather API, getting the specific item from nested objects and arrays.
